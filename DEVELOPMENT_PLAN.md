# DXF Scanner App - Development Plan

## Overview
A Flutter app that captures handwriting/sketches via camera, processes them to extract vector paths, and exports them as DXF files for sharing.

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Pure Dart Implementation (MVP)
**Start with Dart-based processing for faster development and easier deployment.**

#### Image Processing Pipeline:
1. **Image Capture** → Camera/Gallery
2. **Preprocessing** → Grayscale, Noise Reduction, Contrast Enhancement
3. **Edge Detection** → Sobel/Canny algorithms using `image` package
4. **Vectorization** → Contour detection and path extraction
5. **DXF Generation** → Custom DXF writer
6. **Export/Share** → File generation and sharing

#### Advantages:
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ Easier debugging and testing
- ✅ Smaller app size
- ✅ No native dependencies
- ✅ Faster development cycle

#### Performance Considerations:
- Process images in background isolates
- Implement progress callbacks
- Add image size limits for processing
- Cache processed results

### Phase 2: FFI Integration (Future Enhancement)
**Add C++ libraries for advanced processing if needed.**

#### Potential C++ Libraries:
- **OpenCV** - Advanced image processing and computer vision
- **Potrace** - Bitmap to vector conversion
- **Tesseract** - OCR for text recognition
- **Custom algorithms** - Optimized for handwriting

#### FFI Implementation Strategy:
```dart
// Example FFI structure
class ImageProcessor {
  static final DynamicLibrary _lib = Platform.isAndroid
      ? DynamicLibrary.open('libimage_processor.so')
      : DynamicLibrary.process();
      
  static final _processImage = _lib
      .lookupFunction<Int32 Function(Pointer<Uint8>, Int32), int Function(Pointer<Uint8>, int)>('process_image');
}
```

## Architecture

### Core Components:
1. **ImageCaptureService** - Camera and gallery integration
2. **ImageProcessor** - Image processing algorithms
3. **Vectorizer** - Path extraction and optimization
4. **DXFGenerator** - DXF file creation
5. **FileManager** - File operations and sharing
6. **AppState** - State management with Provider

## Implementation Priority

### Week 1: Foundation
- [x] Project setup and dependencies
- [ ] Basic app structure and navigation
- [ ] Camera integration
- [ ] Image capture and preview

### Week 2: Core Processing
- [ ] Image preprocessing (grayscale, noise reduction)
- [ ] Basic edge detection
- [ ] Simple vectorization
- [ ] DXF file generation

### Week 3: Polish & Testing
- [ ] UI/UX improvements
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] File sharing
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Week 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Settings and preferences
- [ ] Batch processing
- [ ] Cloud integration (optional)
- [ ] FFI integration (if needed)

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Performance:
- Image capture: < 2 seconds
- Processing (1024x1024): < 10 seconds
- DXF generation: < 2 seconds
- Total workflow: < 15 seconds

### Optimization Strategies:
1. **Image resizing** before processing
2. **Background processing** with isolates
3. **Caching** of intermediate results
4. **Progressive processing** with UI updates

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests:
- Image processing algorithms
- DXF generation
- File operations

### Integration Tests:
- Camera functionality
- End-to-end workflow
- File sharing

### Performance Tests:
- Processing time benchmarks
- Memory usage monitoring
- Battery impact assessment

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3: AI Integration
- Machine learning for better handwriting recognition
- Style transfer for different fonts
- Automatic text detection and separation

### Phase 4: Cloud Features
- Cloud processing for complex images
- Collaborative editing
- Version history and backup

## Conclusion

Starting with pure Dart implementation provides the fastest path to a working MVP. FFI integration can be added later if performance requirements demand it. The modular architecture allows for easy upgrades and maintenance.
